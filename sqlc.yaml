# name :- Name of the go package that will be generated. db package sounds good
  - name: "db"

    path: "db/sqlc" 
    # queries :- This is the path where sqlc will look for the queries
    queries: "./db/query/"

    # emit_json_tags :- We want sqlc to add JSON tags to the generated structs 
    emit_json_tags: true
    # emit_prepared_queries :- This is used to optimize performace, not required yet
    emit_prepared_queries: false
    # emit_interface :- This generates a Querier interface which is a pass way in to all the CRUD operations.
    # It helps us to mock the db for testing higher level functions
    emit_interface: false
    # emit_exact_table_names :- Sqlc will try to singularize the table name to use as the model struct name.
    # For example “accounts” table will become “Account” struct.
    # If you set this option to true, the struct name will be “Accounts” instead. 
    # I think singular name is better because 1 object of type “Accounts” in plural form might be confused as multiple objects.
